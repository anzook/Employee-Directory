# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory
### An employee directory with React

This was my first exercise and practie working with react, responding to user input and updating state. It allows for a user to explore an employee roster through filtering, sorting, and searching.

## Viewing and using the website
Follow the link to the deployed application above, or 

- Clone and Download the repo
- Install the node dependencies:
`npm instal`

Here is an example of the front end application view/home page:
